\usage{
gen_sim_mat_M(
  network,
  tau = NA,
  restart = 0.7,
  delta = 0.5,
  cond_jump = NULL,
  jump_neighborhood = FALSE,
  weighted_multiplex = FALSE,
  cores = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{a network}

\item{tau}{tau}

\item{restart}{A real in the range of 0-1, it is the probability to restart the algorithm in the starting point}

\item{delta}{delta}

\item{cond_jump}{cond_jump}

\item{jump_neighborhood}{A boolean, if true, the nodes between omics will be connected if they are the same, if false, the nodes will be connected with itself and its neighborhood but in the other omics}

\item{weighted_multiplex}{A boolean, if true, the edge between omics will be weighted}

\item{cores}{Number of threads for Parallelization. It has to be positive integer. If it is equal to 1, no parallelization is not performed}
